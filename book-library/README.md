# My First RESTful Backbonejs APP

In this exercise I am about to build a library application for managing digital books using Backbone. For each Book, I will store the title, author, date of release, some keywords and a cover picture.

###Basic funcitinalities of UI:
* Can add a book to libraeary through UI
* Can delete a record from library
* Can view list of book in application's home page

###API available for following operation
- To add a book into library
- To delete a book from libraty
- To update a book into library
- To get a list of book from library

###In addition to that
a *mongodb* based backend datastorage to save books into library
a *node* server
