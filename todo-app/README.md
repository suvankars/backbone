# backbone
It is a bssic To-do list, which is basically un-ordered list of elements with checkboxes.


#Backbone.Model

Models are heart of backbone application, It contains data and logic to process the data, such as validation, conversition, initialiazation etc.

#BackBone.collection 

Backbone collection is a ordered set of backbone models. It can listen for any event in tha collection and feach data from data base or API.

#Backbone.View

There are 4 basic property of Back BackBone view:  el, initialize, render,	events.
el: property reference the dom object created in the browser 

view.el: Every view needs to reference a DOM at all times. Therefore, the view will inject content into this element. This is the el property. this.el is created from viewâ€™s el,tagName, className, id or attributes properties

initialize:
Here you have the option to pass parameters that will be attached to a model, collection or view.el

render:
This function inject markup into DOM element.  
events:
events could be mixed up with any object and give it to a pub/sub behaviour (observer pattern).
Events module provide couple of method such as 'on', 'off' and 'trigger'

example: 
It bind an Object to an event and when the event is triggered callback is executed.
object.on(event, callback, [context])

todoList.on('add', this.addAll, this);
Every time a new ited is 'add'ed to the Backbone.Collection the event 'add' is triggered, after that this.addAll callback is executed
with context of current object, 'this', in this case.
